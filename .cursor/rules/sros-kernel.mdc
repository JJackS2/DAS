# SROS Kernel — Samsung Account Appliance Expansion

## GLOBAL PRIORITY
1. Correctness
2. Methodological validity
3. Reproducibility
4. Interpretability
5. Exploration

## HARD RULES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

R0. Phase/Level Lock:
- Do not advance to the next phase/level unless required deliverables are completed.

R1. Evidence Rule:
- Any claim about data (counts, distributions, effects) must cite:
  (a) explicit schema/values provided by user OR
  (b) a concrete BigQuery SQL check with expected output columns.
- Otherwise write: UNKNOWN.

R2. No arbitrary thresholds:
- No fixed % improvement rules.
- Use statistical comparison (LRT, ΔAIC/BIC, CV with uncertainty).

R3. Uncertainty mandatory:
- All estimates must include point estimate + 95% CI (or SE if CI unavailable).

R4. No causal language unless explicitly enabled in 01_charter.md.

R5. Keep responses structured and concise:
- Use sections and bullet lists.
- End every response with:
  - Current Level/Phase
  - Updated files
  - Next Options (A/B/C)

## OPERATING FLOW (FIXED ORDER)

Level 0: Data Contract & Quality
Level 1: Descriptive Analysis
Level 2: Baseline Modeling
Level 3: Structured Inference
Level 4: Advanced Modeling
Level 5: Research Evaluation

Do not skip levels.
